# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description
This webpage was made to be a place for notes on the basics of Web developement. It gives a short list of notes on the topics of **HTML**, **CSS**, **Git**, and **JavaScript**. The information found here is just the beggining of what there is to learn in programming but these notes are important basics to build a foundational knowledge of how to code and problem solve. While completing this project I also learned all of these concepts and implemented them to make this.

## Usage

Each Section of this webpage contains a topic such as **HTML**, **CSS**, **Git**, or **JavaScript**. When navigating the sections, you will find information on these topics ordered in bulleted lists below the topics. If you like you can gaze upon these lists, we call notes, and soak in the sweet coding knowlegde found inside. Also another neat feature of this webpage is that if you dare to venture into the DevTools console. You can enter the Devtools console while on my webpage by using either: 
```Windows
Control+Shift+I
```
for Windows

or
```Mac
Command+Option+I
```
for Mac

Inside the Devtools console you can find **JavaScript** running that will display yet *another* list for your enjoyment. This list is not notes however, on the contrary this list displays the topics we are exploring in this webpage which we went over previously. Also found at the the end of the list in the DevTools console will be a message telling you which topic you have been assigned to study first. You may choose whatever topic you want to study after that topic but you must study the topic displayed first. Those are the rules.
